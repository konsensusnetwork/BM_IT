[]{#raw-11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047}[Proto-Banking and the Hawala System](raw-3.xhtml#_idTextAnchor007)

Banks as we think of them in their modern form originated in Italian city states at the dawn of the Renaissance, but the history of proto-banks stretches back thousands of years to various regions of the world. Banking, in the broad sense, is a series of legal and technological layers that people developed on top of commodity money.

The Code of Hammurabi, a Babylonian legal text from nearly four thousand years ago, has sections that provide laws for loans and deposits.[[[83](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-092){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-092-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} The Book of Deuteronomy allows the charging of interest on foreigners but not to fellow Israelites.[[[84](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-091){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-091-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Ancient Greece had a form of proto-bankers over 2,500 years ago called trapezites, named after the trapeza tables they used.[[[85](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-090){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-090-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

A notable development in the history of formal credit was the suftaja and its various pre-cursors. The suftaja was a letter of credit used throughout North Africa, the Middle East, and along the Silk Road by Muslim and Jewish merchants stretching back at least to the eighth century. It arose as a useful development because merchants needed a way to prevent theft or increase efficiency when moving money over long distances, and/or to be able to delegate the transfer of funds to a messenger on their behalf.[[[86](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-089){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-089-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Ghislaine Lydon, a history professor with an emphasis on African and Middle Eastern studies, documented the history of the suftaja in her 2019 research paper, "Paper Instruments in Early African Economies and the Debated Role of the Suftaja." In the paper, she described the suftaja as the following:

As a form of debt contract, the suftaja enabled the transfer of funds among merchants located in distant markets who performed services as international money lenders within established trade networks. The suftaja served essentially two purposes. First, it was a means to send payments or settle debts across long distances; a function akin to a wire transfer. Second, like a traveler's check, it facilitated travel unencumbered by hefty and bulky amounts of cash.[[[87](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-088){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-088-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

She went on to provide an example:

A merchant is traveling on business by caravan between Awdaghust and Sijilmasa. To safeguard his capital he purchases in Awdaghust a suftaja in exchange for a fee from Merchant A who has a relative and/or business partner, Merchant B, located in Sijilmasa. A priori, merchants A and B have established ex-ante a relationship of trust, involving the exchange of long distance financial and commercial services. The traveler deposits his capital with Merchant A, in the presence of witnesses, pays a fee, and receives in exchange a suftaja. This document, often in the form of a letter, instructs Merchant B to pay to the traveler the exact amount of capital. Upon arrival at destination the traveler cashes in the check. The same device was used to make long-distance payments except that the letter, containing the payment instructions, traveled via messenger. Upon reception, Merchant B executed the payment to a third party. A suftaja payment by Merchant B could settle in full or in part a pre-existing debt owed to Merchant A. Viewed another way, as was often the case among legal scholars discussed below, the traveling merchant or the party seeking to make an international payment, gives a "loan" to Merchant A that was reimbursed or disbursed elsewhere by his associate Merchant B to either a traveler or a fourth party. Since Merchants A and B regularly correspond and transact, their financial balances are cleared in the course of such bilateral exchanges.[[[88](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-087){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-087-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3}

As for the common denomination of money in the suftaja, Lydon points toward precious metals:

The dinar was the most common international denomination among medieval Muslims, and it featured prominently in suftajas. Dinars had minting and market specificities, including Maghribi and Baghdadi variants, and were pegged to the local price of gold.[[[89](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-086){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-086-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The development of papyrus-based (and eventually paper-based) bills of exchange in time broadened into a form of proto-banking called the hawala system, which traces back over 1,200 years to early Indian and Arab traders. Although the system approximately followed the timing and geographic spread of Islam, stretching from Africa on one side, up to parts of Europe, through the Middle East, and onward to India on the other side, the system was (and still is) used by both Muslims and non-Muslims.

Hawala is a decentralized network of specialized money brokers, called hawaladars, that operate based on trust and reputation. The system still exists today, using modern technology of emails and phone calls, and processes hundreds of billions of dollars in volumes per year.

The way the system works today is that a "Person A" can go to a "Hawaladar A," and give them money and a password, specifying a "Person B" that this money should be given to. Separately, Person A tells Person B the password (via email or other communications), and Hawaladar A contacts a "Hawaladar B" in another country where Person B lives and gives them the password (also via email or other communications). Finally, Person B can go to Hawaladar B, tell them the password, and they will be given the money by the hawaladar. The hawaladars charge a small fee for this service. Person A has effectively sent money to Person B internationally, despite no money flowing over the border, and without going through any formal banks. The hawaladars just updated a channel-based ledger between themselves. Hawaladar A now owes Hawaladar B the money, which they can settle later. These hawaladars know and trust each other well despite operating over long distances, or know and trust each other indirectly through fellow hawaladars, and thus they can maintain credit with each other in a way that non-trusted parties can't.

In earlier times, the communication channels would have been physical, such as one merchant giving another merchant a password or specifically written paper as part of a trade of physical goods, rather than carrying large amounts of coin with them. Hawaladars could also travel with the merchant or spread the password through a network of shorter trips. These days, the communication happens over the internet.

In this system, Person A and Person B don't have to trust each other, but they do have to trust the hawaladars. The hawaladars also must trust each other, and specifically Hawaladar B must trust that Hawaladar A is good for the money, since Hawaladar B paid out money to person B and is now owed that money by Hawaladar A. The reason this trust-based system works is that the hawaladars are professional merchants and they survive in this profession because of their reputations. If a hawaladar fails to settle a valid transaction, he'll no longer be trusted by fellow hawaladars, and will no longer be part of the network.

Hawaladars can settle money over long distances with each other more safely and more efficiently than regular people can settle money. They deal with large numbers of transactions and can "net" transactions. For a medieval example, Hawaladar A might send a note worth ten gold coins for Person A, and a now owes those ten gold coins to Hawaladar B who paid out the money to Person B. The next week, perhaps Person C comes to that same Hawaladar B, and asks them to send six gold coins to Person D, through Hawaladar A. Hawaladar A now owes only four gold coins to Hawaladar B, since the six gold coins can be netted out from the prior ten gold coins that were sent in the other direction. Perhaps they perform dozens of these back-and-forth transactions per year and settle once at the end of the year via a secure process of one physical settlement. The same example could be denominated in dollars, rupees, or other units.

This system allows payments to move long distances, while the money itself moves much less frequently. Collectively, these hawaladars form a decentralized ledger and channel-based payments system, which normal users of the network can access through their local hawaladar. Nobody knows or keeps track of the full network ledger; there is no master hawaladar that they all report to. Instead, it operates by individual hawaladars keeping accurate books for their individual channels with other hawaladars, along with reputations in the broader region so that each hawaladar is known by many hawaladars.

In some countries today, the hawala system is discouraged or outright illegal since it is a way to transfer funds anonymously and across borders. It has been associated with terrorism in some contexts because terrorists will indeed use whatever tools are available to them, although the system itself stretches back to medieval times. In other countries like the United Arab Emirates the practice is allowed and regulated, and as a result the UAE serves as a hub for the modern-day version of the network.

It has been a challenge for historians to determine the precise etymology and exact chain of events regarding specific words or technologies for paper-based forms of exchange. One of the cited reasons for the lack of clarity is that medieval Muslim scholars often debated and discouraged the usage of suftajas and/or the broader hawala system due to its usage of debt and arbitrage, despite it being centered primarily throughout their regions. Therefore, in many contexts the system was off the record. In a 2007 paper with an extensive list of citations called "Misplaced Blame: Islam, Terrorism, and the Origins of Hawala,"[[[90](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-085){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-085-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Edwina Thompson cites Richard Grasshoff when classifying the relationship between hawala and suftaja:

Grasshoff demonstrates that hawala refers to the legal concept of delegation of debt, rather than to a concrete application, while the term suftaja, by contrast, refers to a bill of exchange as one of the possible commercial instruments based on hawala. \[\...\] Technically speaking, it could therefore be argued that customers operate at a level of the suftaja, while dealers more accurately operate a hawala-based system.[[[91](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-084){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-084-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Eventually, economic and military contact between Muslim and Christians spread the usage of these and related monetary technologies to Europe. In a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta called, "The Evolution of the Check as a Means of Payment: A Historical Survey," the authors Stephen Quinn and William Roberds describe the spread of payment technologies as follows:

Checks appear to have been in common use in the eastern Mediterranean during the first millennium. By the tenth century, checks were widely used in the Muslim world (Ashtor 1972). In contrast, monetary systems in Europe at this time were extremely primitive. There were few coins of reliable value and no banks, much less checks (Usher 1934; Spufford 1988).

During the Crusades, Europeans came into increased contact with the Muslim world and came to adopt, with modifications, the banking and monetary systems they encountered in the eastern Mediterranean. During the thirteenth century, rudimentary banks appeared in commercial cities such as Barcelona, Florence, Genoa, and Venice. The primary purpose of these banks was to facilitate payments among local merchants rather than to provide credit.[[[92](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-083){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-083-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Along these lines, the Catholic order of warrior monks of the 12[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century known as the Knights Templar seem to have adopted these practices.[[[93](#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-082){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-11.xhtml#footnote-082-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} The Knights Templar, based in Jerusalem, operated an extensive network that assisted the crusades by Christians against Muslims. European noblemen, intending to travel and fight in the crusades, could deposit valuables with the Knights Templar in Europe, receive a specialized note in return, and then redeem that note for an equivalent amount of value from a different group of Knights Templar upon their arrival in Jerusalem.

As this chapter ends, we'll finish with the question, "who controls the ledger?" The answer as it pertains to these systems is that the hawaladars (and various merchants, templar, and other channel-based proto-bankers) control the ledger. Users of the network must trust individual hawaladars to operate correctly, and individual hawaladars must trust each other.

[]{#raw-12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor048}[The Innovation of Double-Entry Bookkeeping](raw-3.xhtml#_idTextAnchor008)

In 1494, Luca Pacioli of Italy wrote [Summa de arithmetica]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1}, which among other things included a detailed description of double-entry bookkeeping. This work led him to be known as the "Father of Accounting," since his work helped to revolutionize accounting and banking throughout Europe.[[[94](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-105){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-105-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Double-entry bookkeeping splits a ledger into two parts, with those parts being able to reconcile with each other. If someone borrows 10 gold coins from a bank, for example, then those 10 gold coins become a liability for the borrower and an asset for the bank. Both the person and the bank have their half of the ledger that reconcile with each other, where someone's assets equal someone else's liabilities, and this allows for more complex financial systems to arise than were possible before the formulation of this technique. The bank can maintain a complicated set of assets and liabilities and can provide elaborate financial services.

Pacioli, however, didn't invent double-entry bookkeeping. The practice was in its early stages in parts of Italy before he published the work, and some of Pacioli's work was copied from fellow Italian Piero della Francesca. Prior to that, similar techniques were used by Islamic merchants (e.g., the hawala system), and brought to Italy via trade with them as described in the prior chapter. If we go back far enough, we can trace developments back to the Indian numeral system as important developments that eventually made double-entry bookkeeping more workable, and we can trace the earliest accounting back to Mesopotamia as described in this book's first chapter on ledgers. Pacioli's organization and publishing of these techniques became historically important and helped to spread and standardize the practice going forward from that point.

Importantly, these developments helped to improve payment systems in Venice, Florence, and other regions of modern-day Italy. Moneylenders in various forms had existed for thousands of years by this point, but these accountants in Italian city-states took the practice to a whole new level and gave rise to modern banking. The word "bank" is based on the Italian word [banco]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1} which means "bench." Venice and Florence had rather free and open commerce compared to other regions in Europe at the time and traded significantly with Arab merchants. Accountants would sit on benches in the merchants squares and serve as bankers for the merchant class.[[[95](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-104){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-104-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The development of banking made it so that merchants didn't have to bring large numbers of coins with them, and this development reduced friction and risk of trade. If two merchants both have an account open with one of the bankers, they could complete a trade by attesting to that banker to update the ledger. The banker merely changes the credits that he has for the two merchants, subtracting some from the buyer and adding some to the seller, minus a fee that he keeps for his services. To the extent that a merchant wants to settle with a banker by withdrawing or depositing physical gold, it can be done less frequently and therefore under more secure conditions. From there, bankers could combine this practice with banknotes, and become large institutions.

Paper financial instruments had already been devised in several regions. As described in the prior chapter, papyrus and paper-based bills of exchange were used as far back as Ancient Egypt and Ancient China and along the Silk Road. These early bills of exchange were generally linked to a specific person. For a simplistic example, I would have a paper receipt that says, "Lyn Alden is entitled to the payment of five ounces of gold from XYZ individual." Only me, or someone who can legally operate on my behalf, can use that paper to withdraw that gold from that specific individual.

Eventually, many of these papers became bearer assets in standardized amounts out of convenience. This meant that whoever the bearer of the paper is, can withdraw the gold.[[[96](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-103){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-103-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Again, in simplistic terms for the purpose of example, such a paper would say, "The bearer of this banknote is entitled to the withdrawal of five gold ounces from XYZ deposit institution." Merchants could use these papers in place of physical gold to trade with each other, in addition to maintaining their accounts with banks. Unlike the channel-based suftaja/hawala system, the acceptance of these bearer asset banknotes would be widespread as a general medium of exchange and would be linked to the reputation of a rather large financial institution.[[[97](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-102){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-102-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

In terms of payment technologies, we can summarize this shift from proto-banking to full-service banking in three primary steps, based around increasing levels of "negotiability." Negotiable, in financial jargon, means that a paper instrument can be transferred to a different party. In the first step, a simplistic non-negotiable paper instrument can only be redeemed for money by a specific party, as described in the original creation of the paper. In the second step, a paper instrument is made out to a specific party and is intended to be redeemed by them but is negotiable and therefore can be physically signed over to another party who can then redeem it instead. This involves a more complex and trusted financial network between a greater number of counterparties. In the third step, a paper instrument such as a banknote is inherently a bearer asset with nobody's name on it and can be freely exchanged between parties without any need to sign or otherwise transfer its ownership other than by physical possession. This third form requires and relies on large and widely recognized institutions.[[[98](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-101){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-101-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The combination of bank accounts and banknotes, and the expansion of non-negotiable channel-based paper systems into widespread negotiable bearer-based paper systems, greatly enhanced the portability, liquidity, and effective divisibility of gold over time. Thanks to abstraction, the legal ownership of gold could now move much more frequently than the underlying physical gold.[[[99](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-100){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-100-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} It increased the convenience and safety of dealing with large amounts of money, but also opened the possibility for counterparty risk and arbitrage. We can visualize the development of these networks almost like a paper version of the internet: Early channel-based connections eventually grew into an incredibly complex and interconnected set of entities that recognized and operated with each other. All of these paper assets represented claims for gold, but they required trust that the custodian of the gold would maintain it responsibly.[[[100](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-099){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-099-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} In addition, silver coins were still useful at this time because this banking process had considerable overhead costs and was therefore not suitable for everyone to use --- particularly those in the bottom half of the wealth spectrum.

In many parts of medieval Europe, double-entry bookkeeping could also be maintained to some degree with tally sticks. If a creditor lent money to a borrower, they could record the details of the loan using a series of marks on a specialized wooden stick, and then break that stick in half lengthwise. The lender and the borrower would each keep their half of the stick so that they could fit the halves back together as proof that neither half was tampered with. Tallies were yet another form of ledger-keeping, and were tamper-resistant, but were physically inefficient from the lender's point of view since they had to maintain possession of many individual tally sticks.[[[101](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-098){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-098-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3}

A Slide Toward Fractional Reserve Practices

The most basic type of bank serves as a 100% asset-backed custodian. People deposit gold or another monetary asset, and the custodian bank issues paper claims against it; the bank doesn't do anything else with it other than keep it safe. Custodians generally charge fees for the services they provide.

Related examples today include holding physical gold in a vault, where you'll usually have to pay a recurring vaulting fee. The same is true for a safe deposit box. If you hold an exchange-traded fund filled with stocks, the fund charges an administrative fee. These are various types of full reserve custodial and administrative services. Rather than making money from lending out your assets (and thus risking the possibility that they won't get them back), they mostly just hold them and charge you a fee to cover their overhead and make a profit.

In a free market, bankers will naturally compete for market share by charging different levels of fees. And inevitably, bankers will realize that most of the gold never gets withdrawn at once, and instead it just sits there. Imagine, for example, a banker who realizes that in the past ten years of running a full reserve bank, the biggest aggregate withdrawal that he ever had by customers was 40% of the gold at once. He therefore decides that if he has at least 80% of the depositors' gold on hand, then he should be more than safe. He could put the other 20% of the gold to work by lending it out carefully for interest, earn some profits by doing so, and therefore offer a zero-fee service --- which will allow his bank to collect far more deposits. He has invented fractional reserve banking.

If he doesn't tell his customers what he is doing, then it is fraud, since they don't realize that 20% of their gold is being lent out and risked. If he tells them what he is doing and they agree to it, then it's a conscious trade-off. From the perspective of a potential depositor, maybe it seems quite reasonable for the banker to have 80% of the deposits on hand, and the other 20% in the form of illiquid loans to generate some extra income and eliminate fees for the depositor. And if indeed that is what consumers want as a trade-off, then more banks will be forced to fractionally reserve their deposits to eliminate fees as well, with some remaining as 100% reserve fee-based banks to serve the most risk-averse people who see the problems that this can lead to.

If most banks use this method, then there will be more claims for gold throughout the market than there is physical gold. Initially, the economy will likely boom from this expansion of credit, and therefore the region's rulers will like the practice, and probably encourage it.

However, banks can take this too far. If 80% reserves and zero-fee banking is an appealing combination, then how about 60% reserves and rather than merely eliminating fees, the bank gives depositors a small share of the lending profits in the form of interest on their deposits? Surely that will attract tons of deposits, and what are the odds that depositors in aggregate will try to withdraw more than 60% of their gold at once? Bankers in this system will tend to keep pushing the limit, resulting in less reserves as a percentage of deposits, so that depositors can be rewarded (knowingly or unknowingly) for taking on more and more custodial lending risk. There is an inherent aspect of instability in this type of design because it relies on the false promise that demand depositors can pull their funds out at any time, even though if most of them were to try at once, they wouldn't be able to.

It is important to note that an individual fractional reserve bank, assuming it is not insolvent from bad loans, still has as at least as much assets as it does liabilities; it's just that not all the assets are in liquid form that are able to be withdrawn at once. The real problem is that in a financial system that consists of multiple fractional reserve banks, there are far more systemwide deposits than there is underlying gold. Money lent from one institution can be deposited at another institution and immediately (and fractionally) lent from there, resulting in the double-counting, triple-counting, quadruple counting, and so forth, of deposits relative to base money. At that point, people have far more claims for gold than the amount of gold that really exists in the system, and so in some sense, their wealth is illusory. This makes the system inherently unstable and prone to cascading bank runs, where any given bank run can easily lead to many other bank runs happening. A fractional reserve banking system is like a game of musical chairs; it functions for a while but if something ever stops the music, it can all fall apart quickly.

To make it worse, the incentives surrounding bank runs at fractional reserve banks are more problematic than they appear on the surface. Suppose that a bank makes loans as part of its asset mix, and some of those loans are defaulted on. The bank now only has 90% of deposits backed by gold or other assets, having lost the rest on defaulted loans. At first, this might not seem like too big of a problem; the depositors enjoyed years of low fees or even interest-sharing, and now they will take a 10% loss on their deposits due to bad risk management by the bank. Unfortunately, however, the situation won't be that benign if left to its own devices. As soon as some well-connected depositors get a hint that the bank is insolvent, they can pull their money out quickly. When others see that happen, they start to do it as well. If this goes unchecked, then eventually all the deposits will be pulled out, and the laggards who don't pull their deposits out will get nothing. It's not as though everyone takes a 10% loss on their deposits equally; those who pull out quickly can avoid any loss while those who try to pull out last can lose everything since there are no reserves left by that point. Therefore, the inherent incentives encourage bank runs at the earliest sign of insolvency by rewarding those who pull deposits out first. Due to repeated crises, authorities began deploying regulatory and insurance schemes to try to spread out the risk and disincentivize this type of depositor behavior.

These stability problems are more fundamentally solvable by strictly matching the durations of deposits and loans. In this type of system, "demand deposits" and banknotes can be withdrawn or redeemed at any time, and thus need to be fully backed by gold. Meanwhile, certificates of deposit lock up depositor funds for longer durations in the form of an investment contract or "time deposit" and can be used by the bank to make loans of the same duration or less. This method avoids making promises regarding liquidity to demand depositors that might not be able to be kept and prevents the excessive rehypothecation and duration mismatching that fractional reserve banking systems rely on. However, this method has not generally been what societies have turned to in practice. Bankers (along with their regulators and their clients) have instead historically turned to fractional reserve banking, meaning they just live with the underlying duration mismatch and "hope" that not too many demand depositors want their money back at once. The ubiquitous practice of fractional reserve banking has therefore been a large contributor to financial crises occurring so frequently and in every jurisdiction.

Modern banks typically have 5x-10x as much deposits as they have liquid cash reserves (500% or 1,000% leverage), with the rest of their assets consisting of various securities and loans. And most of the liquid cash reserves they do have aren't even in the form of physical cash; it's in abstract central bank reserves.[[[102](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-097){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-097-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3} It only takes a small fraction of people pulling their money out to cause a liquidity shortage. In contrast to a gold-backed banking system, in this modern reserve system a central bank can create more base money whenever needed, and thereby fix bank runs by diluting everyone's money.[[[103](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-096){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-096-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3}

Figure 6-A shows the historical ratio of U.S. commercial bank deposits to U.S. commercial bank cash. From the 1980s through 2008, the ratio climbed from around 6x to 23x, meaning at its peak there was only 1 dollar in bank cash for every 23 dollars in deposits, which is 2,300% leverage. Banks subsequently encountered the global financial crisis, and the U.S. Federal Reserve created a lot of new bank cash and used it to buy assets from the banks. The ratio of deposits to cash therefore dropped significantly and has been lower ever since, ranging from around 5x to around 6x (meaning the system is "only" 500% or 600% leveraged).

[Figure 6-A]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1}[[[104](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-095){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-095-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

As of the end of 2022, banks in the United States had approximately \$18 trillion worth of deposits that they owed to customers, and only had a little over \$3 trillion worth of liquid bank cash.

That sounds (slightly) less scary when we consider that, at the end of 2022 banks had about \$22.6 trillion in total assets (of which \$3 trillion was liquid bank cash). Their other assets consist of things like mortgages, government bonds, and business loans. Overall, banks have more assets than they have liabilities, but most of the assets are loans and securities rather than cash on hand. The financial system cannot withstand a significant percentage of depositors pulling out their cash at once. If they were to try, they would be denied.[[[105](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-094){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-094-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} In fact, at the end of 2022, U.S. banks had only around \$100 billion in actual physical cash on hand; the rest of their cash was in the form of intangible bank reserves listed as assets for them on the ledger of the central bank. During 2023, there were indeed some bank runs against banks that had mismanaged some of their assets during the Federal Reserve's rapid tightening of monetary policy, resulting in some of the largest bank failures in American history.

Part 4 of this book provides additional examples of fractional reserve lending and deposit creation within the context of a fiat currency banking system rather than a gold-backed banking system. For now, focusing on older gold-backed banking systems, we can ask the question, "Who controls the ledger"?

The answer is that each bank controls its own sub-ledger.[[[106](#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-093){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-12.xhtml#footnote-093-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} When customers deposit funds at a bank, they are trusting that the banks are both ethical and competent, and either that they will fully retain the funds (in the case of full reserve custodian services) or if they do take risks, that they will do so prudently (in the case of fractional reserve banking).

In addition, we could say that the government partially controls the full ledger. There are not that many different banks in a country, and so government officials could easily go to each bank and order them to do something. Maybe they want to freeze or confiscate someone's deposits, for example. The bank would have to comply with this, whether the government is doing it for fair reasons or not. Maybe the government is persecuting someone for their religion, political affiliation, their sexual orientation, or for speaking inconvenient truths, which would be terrible. Or maybe the government is prosecuting someone for being a thief or con artist, and therefore is performing reasonable legal actions to administer justice. A government could also force all banks in its jurisdiction to hand over their gold to a central authority and give them paper IOUs for it, which is inevitably what happened to various countries over time. It's easier for a government to get the gold from a handful of banks than it would be to get it from each individual household.

Overall, it's the combination of the banks and the government that have power over the ledger that most people use as money in any banking system. For a gold-backed banking system, the only part of the ledger that individual users have control of is the precious metal coins that they retain in their own custody, and for that they rely on the properties of nature to maintain the integrity of the ledger. Once they surrender coins over to the banking system, they have begun to rely on a hierarchy of other people to control their money.

Chapter 7

[]{#raw-13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor049}[Free Banking vs Central Banking](raw-3.xhtml#_idTextAnchor009)

Over centuries, various banking models have been used. For the purposes of this chapter we can divide national banking systems into two types: free banking and central banking.

The banks described in the prior chapter were examples of free banks. Free banks hold base money (such as gold) and have liabilities to the depositors that represent claims on that money. They also may issue banknotes that represent claims on that money, which serve as bearer assets that are not assigned to any individual but instead give the bearer (holder) of the banknote access to the base money. Individual banknotes will often be passed around as bearer asset currency, and only occasionally used to withdraw the base money from the bank.[[[107](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-121){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-121-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Figure 7-A shows an example of a full reserve, gold-backed free banking system.

![](image/Image34328.png){._idGenObjectAttribute-5}

Figure 7-A

In most contexts, however, free banks used a fractional reserve model. They collected gold deposits, held some of that gold in their vault, and lent some of the gold out for interest. Due to generating profit on the deposits via lending, the bank can waive fees or pay interest to depositors. This increases risks for the bank and the depositors, because if too many people want their gold back at once, the bank will have to suspend withdrawals. [[[108](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-120){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-120-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Figure 7-B shows an example of a 50% fractional reserve, gold-backed free banking system.

![](image/Image34336.png){._idGenObjectAttribute-6}

Figure 7-B

The answer to "who controls the ledger?" in this scenario is a combination of nature and individual banks. In a free banking system based on gold or some other natural base money, the amount of base money in the country is determined by the forces of geology and international trade. The supply of gold may be expanded with the discovery of new deposits (such as was the case for the California gold rush). Alternatively, the supply of gold may be expanded or reduced by running trade surpluses or trade deficits respectively. If the people of a country in aggregate continually buy more than they sell to people in foreign nations, then the country will run a structural trade deficit, and gold will continually flow out of the country and into the coffers of its foreign trading partners. If a country is highly productive, and people in it sell more goods and services to foreign nations than they buy, then the country will run a structural trade surplus, and gold will continually flow into the country.

Throughout the 18[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} and 19[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} centuries, free banking was prevalent in many countries. It was particularly successful in Canada, Switzerland, and Scotland despite relying on duration mismatching. The turbulent free banking era in the United States from the 1830s to the 1860s was filled with numerous bank failures and is often pointed to as evidence for the failure of free banking as a concept, but this was a small and troubled time in the bigger and more global history of free banking that generally can be described as having a mixed success rate. George Selgin's 1988 book on the theory of free banking provided useful research into 19[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}-century free banking practices.[[[109](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-119){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-119-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Selgin went on to provide decades of additional research in the form of books and scholarly articles on the subject to the present day.

In his book on the history of money, Glyn Davies listed examples of different free bank regulations on a state-by-state basis. Massachusetts allowed nearly anyone to create a bank, and with minimal requirements. New York had more stringent requirements, with various capital requirements along with the necessity to keep a reserve of precious metal coins equal to at least 12.5% of circulating banknotes. Louisiana had a tighter requirement of reserving banknotes with at least one-third precious metal coins in reserve for circulating banknotes, along with other capital and liquidity regulations.[[[110](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-118){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-118-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3}

In contrast to free banking, central banking standardizes and centralizes the national ledger and the banknotes. In this type of system, a central bank is recognized or established by the government, and each bank uses the central bank's ledger as its base money. Rather than holding their reserves as vaulted gold, they hold their reserves as entries on a central bank's ledger, and the central bank (or its government) holds the gold --- assuming for the moment that the system is still gold-backed, as it once was. The central bank replaces individual banks as the issuer of banknotes.[[[111](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-117){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-117-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The central bank itself has both assets and liabilities. Their liabilities are primarily the reserves that individual banks store with them, as well as all the banknotes in circulation that are issued by the central bank. The assets can vary depending on the period of history. They might have gold as their primary assets, for example. In the modern fiat era, central banks use government bonds as their primary assets.

Figure 7-C shows an example of a fractional reserve, gold-backed central banking system.

![](image/Image34343.png){._idGenObjectAttribute-7}

Figure 7-C

In this framework, the central bank mainly determines the amount of base money (the sum of physical currency and bank reserves) in the system. If there is a crisis, the central bank can create more base money, and can serve as a lender of last resort due to this flexibility. Specifically, they have some flexibility regarding how much of their base money is backed by physical gold, if the system is functioning pretty well. In many contexts during the late 19[th]{.Super .CharOverride-3} century and early 20[th]{.Super .CharOverride-3} century, central banks would be mandated to have at least 35% or 40% gold backing, and therefore tried to keep the number above the required threshold most of the time.[[[112](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-116){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-116-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3} In simplified terms: if too many people pulled gold out of the system, a central bank could raise interest rates (more specifically "discount rates") to entice some of that gold to be deposited back in --- either domestically or from abroad. If a central bank had plenty of gold on hand, they could cut interest rates (discount rates) to stimulate credit growth and economic expansion.

Central banking consists of several layers of abstraction and centralization. Individual depositors in banks are powerless within this type of system. Each bank is also effectively powerless because all its assets consist of IOUs. The central bank holds all the power, and a central bank can be controlled by the government. When we ask our recurring question --- "who controls the ledger?" --- we can see that the answer to this question changes a bit between free banking and central banking.

In a gold-backed free banking system, the answer is that nature and individual banks control the ledger, with the government in turn having the option to influence or take over banks to varying degrees. The properties of nature continue to provide scarcity for the underlying precious metal, and people can still directly hold precious metal coins, bars, and jewelry. To the extent that they deposit funds into a bank, that bank controls that part of the ledger.

In a gold-backed central banking system, the answer is that nature still provides scarcity for the underlying precious metal, but it's becoming increasingly removed from everyday operation of the system. Individual banks are barely in control anymore, because rather than vaulting gold directly, they store their reserves as entries on the central bank ledger. They can lose funds (including customer deposits) by making bad loans, but they have no agency over the value of their own reserves, since they have a layer of abstraction between themselves and the underlying metal. The central bank now controls the ledger for deposits and their underlying reserves throughout the country. The only control that individuals retain is the portion that they hold themselves in precious metal coins.

A Brisk Walk Through American Monetary History

Banking systems have trended toward centralization over time. This happened in various European countries, and then the United States and other countries went through a similar process. The rather recent and continuous history of the United States provides a useful walkthrough for how this centralization tends to happen.

The founding of the United States and its monetary system happened in phases. The Revolutionary War began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence was written in 1776. During the war era, the Continental Congress issued banknotes called Continentals, which eventually hyperinflated.[[[113](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-115){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-115-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} The Constitution went into effect in 1789. The Coinage Act of 1792 made the silver dollar the base unit of account in the United States and established the U.S. Mint to issue standardized legal tender coinage. Within that Coinage Act, a silver dollar was established to be equivalent to 371.25 grain (24.1 grams) silver. A tri-metallic decimal system was structured around it as follows:

[•]{._idGenBNMarker-1}Half cents: 132 grain of copper, denominated as \$0.005.[[[114](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-114){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-114-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The First Bank of the United States was established in 1791, but it was not a true central bank, and was limited in its scope due to the deeply embedded controversy about having a central bank at the time. It had a finite charter of 20 years which expired in 1811. In 1816, the Second Bank of the United States was established, similarly limited in scope, and lasted for another 20 years until 1836.[[[115](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-113){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-113-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Various commercial banks existed at this time; they could issue banknotes and used precious metals and other assets as reserves that those banknotes were redeemable for. So, while the government's role was to standardize and produce coinage for the national unit of account, it left the issuance of paper banknotes to individual banks. Any money put into circulation by the government itself was limited by the availability of precious metals; they couldn't just create money out of thin air. Banks could use various types of collateral for their banknotes, but to be credible they had to be able to honor redemptions of banknotes for precious metals on demand.

States regulated the individual banks within their jurisdictions. There is often a lot of corruption in terms of who gets to run a bank, because it's very lucrative to be one of the entities allowed to issue fractionally reserved banknotes. Branching was often limited or disallowed, meaning that a bank could not open several different branches in several different states. This prevented banks from diversifying their deposits and loans properly across geographies, and thus they were quite prone to bank runs and various liquidity and solvency crises. Compared to Canada, Sweden, and Scotland, free banking in the United States was a lot more restricted, and these individual banks in aggregate were not very safe outside of certain jurisdictions.[[[116](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-112){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-112-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

In the 1860s, under President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War, the country began to centralize its banking system. The National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864 established a set of national banks with stricter regulations, established a national paper currency issued by national banks that were backed up partially by government bonds, and expanded the ability of the federal government to issue war bonds. Each national bank, as part of its setup process, had to buy government bonds and deposit them with the Comptroller of the Currency. Further legislation in 1865 effectively taxed state banknotes out of existence, establishing the national banknotes as the near monopoly on currency issuance.[[[117](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-111){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-111-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

To fund the American Civil War in the 1860s, the U.S. federal government began issuing "greenbacks" as fiat currency --- first in the form of demand notes and then in the form of United States notes. At this point, the U.S. federal government was engaging in seigniorage --- it could issue currency and debt for nearly zero cost. This gave them the ability to absorb savings from the population (as long as they could retain some degree of credibility and reputation) and channel those savings toward the war effort. While their valuations relative to gold did fluctuate, the monetary properties of the greenbacks were managed better than the Continentals and avoided hyperinflation. On the other side of the war, the Confederate States of America also issued fiat currency to channel peoples' savings toward the war, and their currency went on to hyperinflate due to their loss in the war.[[[118](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-110){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-110-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

After the war ended, a multi-decade disagreement between creditors and debtors emerged. Creditors, referring especially to the wealthier financial class centered in the Northeast, wanted to tighten the money supply as much as possible, including retiring the fiat greenbacks and demonetizing silver, so that the dollar would only be pegged to gold. Debtors, referring to farmers and certain other working-class groups and organizing under the "Free Silver" movement, tended to be more in favor of keeping the greenbacks in circulation and maintaining both gold and silver as money, which would allow for a larger supply of dollars.[[[119](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-109){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-109-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} This brought to attention an important issue: dollars were merely an abstraction of value, redeemable for [something]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1} of value which meant that the definition of a dollar could change in a political group's favor by shrinking or expanding its supply. Savers and creditors of dollars will naturally want a stronger dollar; debtors that owe dollars will naturally want a weaker dollar. In this case the hard money side won; the Coinage Act of 1873 and the Gold Standard Act of 1900 demonetized silver and set the country on a gold standard until 1933.

Much analysis on inflation decries the printing of money by governments and central banks, and indeed money-printing is something that occurs frequently in the modern era. But similar attention must be paid to the centralized destruction of money as well. When savers save money in a unit of account that they expect to be stable, and that unit of account is rapidly printed or redefined to be weaker by a central authority (reduced in terms of purchasing power), then it is basically a breach of contract for savers. Conversely, when debtors borrow money in a unit of account that they expect to be stable, and that unit of account is rapidly destroyed or redefined to be stronger by a central authority (increased in terms of purchasing power), than it is likewise a breach of contract for debtors.

With the 1913 Federal Reserve Act a third national bank of the United States was established, and the first true central bank of the country: the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve was constructed as a system of twelve Federal Reserve banks, which are owned by commercial banks but are overseen by a board of federally appointed officials. The Act gave the Federal Reserve authority to oversee the banking system, serve as lender of last resort, and issue Federal Reserve banknotes. The Federal Reserve held gold among its assets and administered the ledger that served as the monetary base for the country, with commercial banks storing their reserves as entries on the Federal Reserve's ledger.[[[120](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-108){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-108-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

During the Great Depression in 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102, which made it a criminal offense, punishable by up to ten years in prison, for Americans to own gold anywhere in the world other than small amounts for things like wedding rings. People were told to hand over their gold and were given the existing pegged exchange rate of 20.67 dollars per ounce in return. In the next year, the 1934 Gold Reserve Act barred all banks from redeeming dollars for gold and required the Federal Reserve to hand over all its gold to the United States Treasury. Through the combination of these actions, large amounts of gold were handed over by the public to the U.S. federal government in exchange for paper dollars and bank deposits.

After the 1934 Gold Reserve Act, the federal government then sharply devalued the dollar relative to gold. An ounce of gold went from being worth 20.67 dollars to 35 dollars. This allowed them to expand the monetary base in dollar terms relative to their amount of gold reserves, and thus devalue peoples' dollar-denominated savings --- as well as devalue various debts, including the federal debt. The federal government constructed the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox and transferred their gold to that location.[[[121](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-107){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-107-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Although it was illegal for Americans to own gold for approximately four decades, many of them secretly did, and the ban wasn't very enforceable in practice. It's easy for a government to get all the gold out of banks with the stroke of a pen, but to get all the smaller amounts of gold out of individual households would require a much more expensive and draconian operation. They had to be content with getting a significant percentage of it, mainly from banks and from individuals who willingly turned it over early on to avoid the low chance of getting caught.

From the 1933 until 1971, dollars were still redeemable for gold by foreign central banks at this new devalued rate, but not by American citizens, and not by foreign private entities. In 1971, the United States defaulted on foreign redemption as well, and rendered the dollar redeemable for nothing. After that point, the dollar's fall in value accelerated. By the 1980s and 1990s, an ounce of gold was worth approximately ten times as many dollars (\$300 to \$400 depending on the year) as it used to be, as dollars were rapidly debased. By the 2010s and 2020s, an ounce of gold was worth well over \$1,000 and at times reached over \$2,000.

Figure 7-D shows the change in purchasing power of the U.S. dollar over time as measured by aggregate price inflation, with key moments annotated.

![](image/Image34384.png){._idGenObjectAttribute-8}

Figure 7-D

As Figure 7-D shows, the War of 1812 and the 1860s Civil War resulted in temporary debasement, but due to the success in those wars, national productivity, and the underlying dollar-to-gold peg, the debasement reversed back to the prior value.[[[122](#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-106){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-13.xhtml#footnote-106-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Starting in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve, followed up by the World Wars, the 1933 elimination of domestic gold redeemability, and then again with the 1971 elimination of international gold redeemability, the dollar sharply fell out of that historical range. And yet despite all of that, the U.S. dollar was the second-best performing currency in the world during this timeframe; most currencies lost value even more quickly.

In 1970, Congress passed the Bank Secrecy Act, which made banks file reports to the government whenever their customers do more than \$10,000 in transactions within a day. Back then, this dollar amount was worth more than the median annual income, and reporting therefore happened rather infrequently. However, the Bank Secrecy Act was not adjusted for inflation, and so over the course of five decades, the government has automatically reduced the threshold for necessary reporting and has therefore continually expanded their surveillance mandate each year without further legislation. The combination of restricting the number of physical banknotes in circulation, making it undesirable to hold physical banknotes for long periods of time due to inflation without interest, and surveilling bank deposits, has been an effective surveillance and control combination.

Figure 7-E shows a simplified version of what the system looks like now, with gold replaced by Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities as the Federal Reserve's primary assets.

The combination of these actions shows why the question of "who controls the ledger" is very important. It also shows how quickly the answer to the question can change.

When people hold precious metals directly, they rely on nature to administer their ledger, since it is mainly the scarcity of the metal available for humans to mine economically that determines to what extent their savings can retain their purchasing power. In addition, people can hand these precious metals to other people, which allows for private, censorship-resistant transactions that don't depend on counterparties. People are, however, vulnerable to physical theft to whatever extent they custody their own coins at home.

When people deposit some of their funds into custodians or free banks that vault some of their gold, they are now relying on both nature and that bank to administer the ledger. The user must trust the scarcity of gold itself and must trust the bank not to mismanage their loan book or to commit fraud. The user also gives up their privacy; their banker knows their wealth and who they deal with; and their government knows their wealth and who they deal with; and both have the power to seize their funds if desired. In exchange, the user gets more convenience including fast, long-distance transaction capabilities. The user can still hold some gold or silver in their own custody, and therefore can decide how to manage the risk/reward of holding their money with themselves and with their bank.

Any time that balances are defined in a unit of account that is pegged to something else, then the authorities who control that peg can determine the fate of both savers and debtors. Changing the rules for that unit to peg it to something scarcer can dramatically harm debtors. Likewise, changing the rules to peg it to something more abundant can dramatically harm savers.

When the government establishes a central bank, and especially if it outlaws gold ownership, it takes monetary power away from the people and gives it almost entirely to banks and government authorities. People at that point have limited ability to custody their own scarce and liquid assets, and instead must rely on the central banking ledger; they must therefore submit to the risks of currency debasement and must give up most of their privacy. Government officials can now more easily take purchasing power away from savers --- not just through transparent taxation but also through non-transparent inflation of the money supply --- and channel it toward their goals. Governments can also more easily surveil and audit everyone's finances.

Chapter 8

[]{#raw-14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050}[The Speed of Transactions vs the Speed of Settlements](raw-3.xhtml#_idTextAnchor010)

From papyrus-based bills of exchange to double-entry booking and paper banknotes, the main purpose of banking was to enable transactions to move more quickly and frequently than the transportation and verification of physical gold would allow. Banking also allowed for the usage of more extensive credit systems, by allowing a third party (a money changer or a bank) to serve as a trusted intermediary between two non-trusting entities (buyers and sellers, or creditors and debtors).

In other words, banking allowed for transactions (commerce) and settlements (money) to be separated. Transactions for individual goods and services could occur more frequently, existing for a period of time in a state of credit, until they were settled with precious metals in less frequent occurrences and in larger amounts. However, while this process of batching multiple transactions into fewer and larger settlements increased transaction efficiency and reduced the risk of theft, it couldn't overcome a fundamental constraint: the speed of information.

For thousands of years, transactions and settlements had the same maximum speed limit: the speed of foot, horses, and ships. Peoples' ability to do transactions, and the bearer assets they transacted with (mainly gold and silver in advanced regions), had no inherent difference in terms of travel speed, although the transactions themselves were more efficient in practice. All of it was limited by the speed of physical human travel. Even the invention of banking couldn't get around this basic limitation. The paper bills of exchange and banknotes, while easier and safer to transport than gold, still couldn't move faster than foot, horses, and ships. Ledger-based account systems, while convenient, still couldn't send information over long distances any faster than the existing modes of physical travel.

However, with the invention of the telegraph, and then the telephone, the speed of transactions increased to nearly the speed of light. The first working telegraph was invented in the 1830s. Engineers then spent much of the 1840s and 1850s figuring out how to run cables over long distances, including under large bodies of water, during which time they were able to connect the various financial centers of Europe together, including London and Paris. After some failed attempts, the first long-lasting transatlantic telegraph cables were put in place in the 1860s, and the global banking system quickly became more interconnected in the decades that followed.[[[123](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-137){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-137-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} From that point, people could transact across the world by updating each other's bank ledgers over telecommunication systems nearly at the speed of light.[[[124](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-136){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-136-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Banks and central banks had full control over that process. Meanwhile, gold and silver as bearer assets still moved slowly, and thus had to be increasingly abstracted to keep up.

Prior to the invention and usage of telecommunication systems, gold and silver were already frequently abstracted with paper claims due to divisibility limitations or security concerns or convenience or the desire to earn interest as described in prior chapters, but once telecommunication technology was invented, their slow speed made it even more necessary to abstract them to keep up. All around the world, people and institutions increasingly relied on interconnected bank accounts rather than coinage.[[[125](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-135){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-135-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} And with currency units abstracted from the underlying metal, it turned currency units into an inherently political topic between creditor groups and debtor groups.

In that book, Jevons provided four separate diagrams shown together in Figure 8-A (now in the public domain) to walk the reader step-by-step through an increasingly connected set of hypothetical banks and how this centralization was occurring over time. The first diagram showed how account holders of a single bank could send money to each other using the bank as a settlement layer. The second diagram showed a connection between two such banks, who accept each other's paper payment instruments so that their accountholders can easily send money to each other across banks as well. The third diagram showed the introduction of a central bank, which allowed for more efficient settlement between many banks. The fourth diagram showed a base layer clearing house, either at a national scale or even a global scale centered in a major financial hub like London, to connect all banks.

![](image/Image34400.png){._idGenObjectAttribute-9}

[Figure 8-A]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1}[[[126](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-134){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-134-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Throughout the book, Jevons excitedly described the increasing abstraction and efficiency of global commerce, as claims for payment could cancel out against other claims between banks and therefore render gold settlements rare and almost irrelevant. And toward the end of the book in a section called "The World's Clearing House", he described London's increasing role as the centralized ledger administrator for the world. Banks from across the whole world had offices in London to connect with the financial network effects that existed there.

\[...\]

It might seem that in the use of cheques internally, and of bills of exchange in foreign trade, we have reached the climax in the economy of metallic money; but there is yet one further step to make. We found that so long as all the merchants of a town keep their cash with the same banker, they have no need to handle the money at all, but can make payments by transfers in the books of their banker. Let us imagine, then, that merchants all over the world agreed to keep their principal accounts with the bankers of any one great commercial town. All their mutual transactions could then be settled among those bankers. An approximation to such a state of things exists in the tendency to make London the monetary head-quarters of the commercial world, and the general clearing house of international transactions. All that is needed to secure economy of money is centralization of transactions, so that there may be the wider scope for the balancing of claims.[[[127](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-133){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-133-backlink}]{.Super .CharOverride-3}

Jevons' book is remarkable in two ways. Firstly, it was excellent at describing the increasing role of technology as it relates to money, from ancient times until its publication in 1875, and how the next few decades would likely come together in even more centralized ways. Secondly, it was prescient at identifying some of the catastrophic problems that such a centralized system could lead to, even though Jevons himself was highly supportive of this centralization for the sake of efficiency and thought that those problems could be managed appropriately.

Specifically, in a series of instances throughout the book, Jevons identified the greater and greater scope of claims for gold relative to the amount of actual gold in the system, due to the ease of dealing with claims rather than the metal itself. He cited numbers from his time showing that a mere four to seven percent of claims were held in reserves by the banking system of the United Kingdom, and that even those reserves were themselves fractional claims for gold.

It is requisite, too, that our bankers, financiers, and merchants should regulate their operations with a thorough comprehension of the immense system in which they play a part, and the risks of derangement and failure which they encounter by over-severe competition. No one doubts that alarming symptoms have during recent years presented themselves in the London money market. There is a tendency to frequent severe scarcities of loanable capital, causing sudden variations of the rate of interest almost unknown thirty years ago. I will therefore in the next chapter offer a few remarks intended to show that this is an evil naturally resulting from the excessive economy of the precious metals, which the increasing perfection of our banking system allows to be practised, but which may be carried too far and lead to extreme disaster.

\[...\]

The metals took the place of other commodities as currency, and delicate considerations began to enter concerning token and standard coins. From metallic representative money, we passed to paper representative money, and finally discovered that, by the cheque and clearing system, metallic money was almost eliminated from the internal exchanges of the country. Pecuniary transactions now present themselves in the form of a room full of accountants, hastily adding up sums of money. But we must never forget that all the figures in the books of a bank represent gold, and every creditor can demand the payment of the metal. In the ordinary state of trade no one cares to embarrass himself with a quantity of precious metal, which is both safer and more available in the vaults of a bank. But in international trade, gold and silver are still the media by which balances of indebtedness must be paid, and serious consequences may arise from any disproportion between the amount of transactions carried on, and the basis of gold upon which they are settled.

È quindi piuttosto evidente che la tendenza sia quella di attuare un commercio sempre più vasto utilizzando una quantità di valuta metallica che non cresce nella stessa proporzione. Anche il sistema bancario diventa più efficiente, migliorando l\'economia con cui il denaro viene impiegato. La concorrenza tra molte grandi banche le spinge a condurre il maggior numero possibile di operazioni con le riserve minime che possono permettersi di mantenere. Alcune di queste banche dichiarano dividendi dal 20 al 25 per cento, un risultato possibile solo grazie a un uso molto audace dei grandi depositi. Inoltre, le riserve non sono costituite tanto da monete o banconote effettive nei caveau, quanto da denaro impiegato a breve termine nel mercato azionario o depositato presso la Banca d\'Inghilterra, che a sua volta concede prestiti su parte di questi depositi.

Ora, più il commercio si espande, maggiore sarà la richiesta occasionale di oro per effettuare pagamenti internazionali; e se la disponibilità di oro conservata a Londra diventa relativamente sempre minore, sarà sempre più difficile soddisfare tale domanda. Questo, credo, sia l\'intero segreto della crescente instabilità e fragilità del mercato finanziario in questo paese. C\'è un numero sempre maggiore di richieste di oro, ma relativamente meno oro per soddisfarle, il che porta periodicamente a difficoltà naturali nel pagamento delle domande. Di conseguenza, il tasso di interesse deve essere improvvisamente aumentato per convincere coloro che possiedono oro a prestarlo, o per indurre chi ne fa richiesta a rinunciare temporaneamente alle loro pretese.

È chiaro che la tendenza attuale è quella di espandere il commercio utilizzando una quantità di valuta metallica che non cresce in modo proporzionale. Parallelamente, il sistema bancario sta evolvendo per utilizzare il denaro in modo sempre più efficiente. La competizione fra le grandi banche le spinge a massimizzare le operazioni di business mantenendo riserve minime. Alcuni istituti riescono a pagare dividendi del 20-25%, un obiettivo raggiunto utilizzando i depositi in maniera piuttosto aggressiva. Anche le riserve non consistono più tanto in monete o banconote fisiche, ma piuttosto in fondi utilizzati a breve termine sul mercato azionario o depositati presso la Banca d\'Inghilterra, che a sua volta offre prestiti basati su questi depositi. Con l\'espansione del commercio, cresce anche la richiesta occasionale di oro per i pagamenti internazionali. Se le riserve di oro a Londra tendono a diminuire proporzionalmente, questo crea difficoltà crescenti nel soddisfare le richieste. Ritengo che questa sia la causa principale dell\'aumento dell\'instabilità e della fragilità del mercato finanziario nel nostro paese. L\'incremento delle richieste di oro va di pari passo con una disponibilità relativamente inferiore, portando a difficoltà nei pagamenti. Di conseguenza, i tassi di interesse devono essere alzati improvvisamente per incentivare chi possiede oro a prestarlo, oppure per convincere coloro che lo richiedono a sospendere temporaneamente le loro pretese.

Mr. R. H. Inglis Palgrave, in his important "Notes on Banking," published both in the Statistical Journal, for March, 1873 (Vol. xxxvi. p. 106), and as a separate book, has given the results of an inquiry into this subject, and states the amount of coin and Bank of England notes, held by the bankers of the United Kingdom, as not exceeding four or five per cent. of their liabilities, or from one twenty-fifth to one twentieth part. Mr. T. B. Moxon, of Stockport and Manchester, has subsequently made an elaborate inquiry into the same point, and finds that the cash reserve does not exceed about seven per cent. of the deposits and notes payable on demand. He remarks that even of this reserve a large proportion is absolutely indispensable for the daily transactions of the bankers' business, and could not be parted with. Thus the whole fabric of our vast commerce is found to depend upon the improbability that the merchants and other customers of the banks will ever want, simultaneously and suddenly, so much as one-twentieth part of the gold money which they have a right to receive on demand at any moment during banking hours.[[[128](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-132){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-132-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Man mano che il sistema bancario globale diveniva sempre più efficiente nell\'equilibrare e compensare gli squilibri, la necessità di metalli rispetto al volume delle transazioni e dei risparmi durante le operazioni quotidiane si riduceva costantemente. Anche i consumatori aderirono volentieri a questo cambiamento, apprezzando la maggiore comodità che offriva. Tuttavia, proprio questa crescente efficienza è ciò che ha permesso al sistema di diventare così privo di supporto e instabile nelle sue fondamenta. La riluttanza della maggior parte delle persone a ritirare e custodire i metalli fisici, ingombranti e scomodi, ha favorito la proliferazione estrema di crediti sull\'oro rispetto alla quantità effettiva di oro disponibile.

Agli inizi del XX secolo, a causa del livello estremo di astrazione monetaria e della facilità con cui si potevano creare crediti durante la Prima Guerra Mondiale --- all\'incirca quattro decenni dopo il libro di Jevons --- il sistema aureo internazionale crollò e non si riprese mai più. Nei decenni successivi, i governi abbandonarono completamente il supporto di oro e argento nei loro sistemi finanziari, portandoci a un mondo composto da 160 diverse valute fiat inflazionistiche, ciascuna con un monopolio locale nella propria giurisdizione. La disparità di velocità tra il commercio transazionale e il denaro-merce basato su beni tangibili offrì ai governi e alle banche un\'enorme opportunità di sfruttare l\'arbitraggio di custodia. Un sistema bancario centralizzato e globalmente interconnesso, monopolizzando i rapidi trasferimenti di valore a lunga distanza, divenne troppo potente e conveniente perché l\'oro potesse tenere il passo, anche se quest\'ultimo poteva ancora rappresentare un\'opzione migliore per il risparmio privato. L\'introduzione delle carte di credito negli anni \'50, del commercio elettronico negli anni \'90 e dei pagamenti tramite smartphone negli anni 2010 ha ulteriormente consolidato l\'importanza dei pagamenti basati su telecomunicazioni rapide.

This is the only time in history where, on a global scale, a weaker money won out in terms of adoption over a harder money.[[[129](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-131){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-131-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} And it occurred because telecommunication systems introduced [speed]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1} as a new variable into the competition. Gold, with its inherently slow speed of transport and authentication, couldn't compete with the pound, the dollar, and other top fiat currencies with their combination of speed and convenience, despite gold being in scarcer supply. The combination of legal tender laws, taxation authority, and greater speed has allowed fiat currencies to outcompete their slower but scarcer precious metal counterparts all over the world in terms of usage. This mismatch or gap in speed has been a foundational reason for the greater and greater levels of financialization that the world has seen over the past century and a half. Monetary ledgers became increasingly detached from any sort of natural constraint or scarce units of settlement, because the only scarce monetary alternatives such as gold were too slow to present a complete alternative.

Barry Eichengreen, in his book [Globalizing Capital]{.Italic ._idGenCharOverride-1}, pointed out that the international central bank gold standard as we know it began in the 1870s.[[[130](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-130){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-130-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} This was right around the time of Jevons' book quoted above. Prior to that, there were frequent uses of bimetallic standards and free banking systems. In the gold standard framework, central banks in Europe held gold, issued currency against that gold (which was fractionally reserved), and used the combination of telecommunication systems and bank ledger divisibility to create a rather fast-moving and convenient set of globally interconnected ledgers. The United States increasingly joined them as well, formally with the Coinage Act of 1873 and the Gold Standard Act of 1900.

L\'emergere della teoria del credito come forma di denaro, in tutte le sue varianti, che ho descritto nel Capitolo 4, si è verificato parallelamente ai progressi tecnologici della seconda metà del XIX secolo. Mentre le richieste di valuta o le cambiali viaggiavano in tutto il mondo alla velocità delle telecomunicazioni, all\'interno di un sistema bancario globale altamente efficiente, molti teorici della moneta iniziarono a chiedersi: \"Perché abbiamo ancora bisogno di questi metalli?\"

Nel 1905, Georg Friedrich Knapp pubblicò \*La Teoria Statale della Moneta\*, in cui descrisse e fondò la teoria monetaria nota come chartalismo. Questa corrente di pensiero fu precorritrice di ciò che oggi conosciamo come Teoria Monetaria Moderna. Essa sosteneva che la moneta avesse origine dai tentativi degli stati di indirizzare l\'attività economica e che il valore della moneta non derivasse dalle merci, ma fosse conferito dallo stato stesso attraverso l\'imposizione di obbligazioni fiscali, soddisfacibili unicamente tramite la valuta emessa dallo stato.

Nel suo saggio del 1914 \*Credit Theory of Money\*, Alfred Mitchell-Innes mise in evidenza gli scritti di Henry Dunning Macleod, risalenti dal tardo 1850 fino agli anni 1890, considerandolo il formulatore originale della teoria del credito. In modo approfondito, sostenne che la moneta non avesse alcuna relazione con il metallo. Non considero una coincidenza il fatto che queste teorie di Macleod, Knapp, Mitchell-Innes e altri si siano sviluppate e abbiano guadagnato importanza proprio nel periodo in cui i registri basati sulle telecomunicazioni diventarono sempre più la norma. Come scrisse Mitchell-Innes:

Non sono il primo a formulare la Teoria del Credito come moneta; questo merito spetta al notevole economista H. D. Macleod. Sebbene molti autori abbiano affermato che alcuni strumenti di credito devono essere inclusi nella definizione di \"moneta\", Macleod è stato quasi l\'unico economista, a mia conoscenza, ad aver trattato scientificamente il tema del sistema bancario e del credito. Egli ha compreso che la moneta si identifica con il credito, e questi articoli rappresentano un sviluppo più coerente e logico del suo insegnamento. Macleod scrisse in un\'epoca molto avanzata rispetto al suo tempo e la mancanza di conoscenze storiche precise gli impedì di comprendere che il credito è più antico dei primi utilizzi delle monete metalliche. Pertanto, le sue idee non si chiarirono mai del tutto, e non riuscì a formulare la teoria di base che una vendita e un acquisto rappresentano lo scambio di una merce per un credito e non per un pezzo di metallo o qualsiasi altra proprietà. In questa teoria risiede l\'essenza dell\'intera scienza monetaria.

Ma anche quando abbiamo compreso questa verità, permangono aspetti oscuri che, allo stato attuale delle nostre conoscenze, non possono essere del tutto eliminati.

Cos\'è un\'unità monetaria? Cos\'è un dollaro?

We do not know. All we do know for certain --- and I wish to reiterate and emphasize the fact that on this point the evidence which in these articles I have only been able briefly to indicate, is clear and conclusive --- all, I say, that we do know is that the dollar is a measure of the value of all commodities, but is not itself a commodity, nor can it be embodied in any commodity. It is intangible, immaterial, abstract. It is a measure in terms of credit and debt.[[[131](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-129){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-129-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Some economists such as Saifedean Ammous have argued that from a monetary perspective, World War I never really ended once it began in 1914. In prior wars throughout history, wars had to be funded with savings or taxes or very slow debasement of coinage. Physical coinage held by citizens could usually only be debased by their government gradually rather than diluted instantaneously, because a government couldn't just magically change the properties of the coins that were held by households; it could only debase them over time by taxing purer coins, issuing various decrees to try to pull some of those purer coins in, and spending debased coins back out into the economy (and convincing initial recipients to accept them at the same prior value, despite the lesser precious metal content, which would only work for a time and might not even be noticed at first). However, with the widespread holding of centrally issued banknotes and bank deposits that were redeemable for specific amounts of gold, governments could change the redemptive value with the stroke of a pen or eliminate redemption all together. This gave governments the power to instantaneously devalue a substantial part of their citizens' savings, literally overnight, and funnel that purchasing power toward war or other government expenditures whenever they determine that the situation calls for it.[[[132](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-128){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-128-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

The pound sterling of the United Kingdom is the world's oldest continuously used currency that is still in use today. In Anglo-Saxon England during the eighth century, the pound sterling was defined as a pound of silver. The definition of a pound back then differed slightly compared to its definition today, and so it was equal to about three-quarters of what we currently define as a pound.[[[133](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-127){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-127-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} Over the next nine centuries, the pound sterling was gradually debased, and lost more than two-thirds of its value by the beginning of the 18[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century. That's quite a slow debasement rate, equal to less than 0.15% compounded debasement per year on average over the course of centuries, although it tended to occur in small stepwise bursts from time to time.[[[134](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-126){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-126-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} By the 1800s, Britain had switched to a gold standard and maintained it until the early 20[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century. It wasn't until World War I, when the pound sterling was completely decoupled from precious metals, that the pound rapidly devalued and lost almost the entirety of its value within one or two human lifetimes. Today a pound sterling is worth less than two grams of silver.

The 20[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century and the beginning of the 21[st]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century have been defined by a greater role of nation states, financed by their flexible ledgers. On one hand, this has allowed for centralized and widespread social safety net implementations, but they tend to be popular enough that they could be financed more transparently in some form or another through taxation. On the other hand, this has allowed for constant warfare and selective bailouts around the world by diluting the savings of others in continuous and non-transparent ways. Corporations can cozy up to governments, and shape legislation that determines where public deficit spending goes, with that spending being opaquely drawn out of peoples' savings through ongoing debasement.[[[135](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-125){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-125-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2}

Although above-ground gold increases in supply by approximately 1.5% per year on average,[[[136](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-124){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-124-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} the broad money supplies of most major countries have grown at an annualized rate of between 6% and 12% since 1960, while the long tail of developing country currencies generally grew at double-digit rates or outright hyperinflated at some point within the period.[[[137](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-123){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-123-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} As a result, people around the world have repeatedly seen their savings debased, especially in developing countries, and for most of this time they have not had an alternative. Gold can still be stored as a long-term niche asset for savings and jewelry, but due to its slow speed and lack of widespread acceptance in modern times --- along with legal tender laws --- gold is not a viable alternative to the global fiat currency system for payments, unless heavily abstracted via trusted counterparties. People often must interact with fiat banknotes and centralized banking system deposits on a regular basis if they wish to make and receive payments in our digital and globally connected world.

Molti critici delle politiche monetarie delle banche centrali o dei governi considerano l\'abbandono del sistema aureo come un fallimento morale. Una delle loro argomentazioni principali è: \"Se solo il governo avesse mantenuto il gold standard, la situazione sarebbe migliore\". Oppure, andando ancora più indietro nel tempo, si sente spesso affermare: \"Se solo non si fosse mai adottato il sistema bancario a riserva frazionaria, avremmo un sistema finanziario più onesto e sostenibile\".

Tuttavia, pur comprendendo e simpatizzando con queste posizioni, e personalmente desiderando che il denaro mantenga il suo valore, vedo la questione da una prospettiva diversa, principalmente attraverso la lente dell\'inevitabilità tecnologica, basata sul divario di velocità tra transazioni e regolamenti che si è ampliato nel tempo. Le persone hanno cominciato a fare transazioni con cessioni rapide di oro e non hanno ritirato oro con sufficiente frequenza per mantenere il numero di tali cessioni \"onesto\". Di conseguenza, il numero di cessioni si è moltiplicato molto più rapidamente rispetto alla disponibilità di oro, e il metallo prezioso è stato poi abbandonato dai governi per mantenere in circolazione quei titoli di credito. Questo fenomeno si è verificato in tutto il mondo.

Out of nearly 200 countries in the world as of this writing, none of them use a gold standard. Switzerland was the longest remaining country on a gold standard, having dropped their gold standard in 1999.[[[138](#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-122){._idFootnoteLink ._idGenColorInherit}]{#raw-14.xhtml#footnote-122-backlink}]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} In most of the world it was gone far earlier during the 20[th]{.Super ._idGenCharOverride-2} century. Something that existed in the past but does not exist anywhere in the present likely has a lack of fitness. The gold standard's weak incentive structure along with the slow speed of gold itself hasn't allowed the gold standard to exist in any form in the modern era. It became too easy for every country in the world to discard it, and so they did. And to the extent that people want to hold more scarce forms of illiquid savings than currencies, they now turn to real estate or corporate equities more-so than they turn to gold. Gold's primary role has been reduced to being a non-correlated portfolio asset among many others, and to serve as a form of macroeconomic disaster insurance due to its ability to be physically possessed by the holder with a high ratio of value to size and weight.

Se dovessimo rivivere questo periodo di sviluppo umano centinaia di volte, credo che ci ritroveremmo quasi sempre nella stessa situazione dal punto di vista monetario, a causa della dipendenza percorsa intrinseca allo sviluppo tecnologico. Con l\'invenzione dei sistemi di telecomunicazione, i registri controllati dalle banche hanno preso il sopravvento, conferendo un potere monetario quasi inespugnabile alle banche e ai banchieri centrali che gestivano questi registri. Per spostare denaro rapidamente, persone e banche hanno finito per affidarsi alla banca centrale del proprio paese come registro principale e, in un contesto internazionale, diversi paesi hanno iniziato a dipendere dal registro della banca centrale dell\'emittente della valuta di riserva mondiale. All\'inizio dell\'era delle telecomunicazioni, questo ruolo era occupato dal Regno Unito, per poi passare agli Stati Uniti nel XX secolo.

Le decisioni politiche influenzano le cose a livello locale e temporaneo, mentre i cambiamenti tecnologici hanno effetti globali e permanenti. Ogni singolo governo, sia esso autoritario o democratico, si è orientato verso un sistema di moneta fiat, svalutando la propria unità di conto a ritmi crescenti. A causa della lentezza nel trasporto e nell\'autenticazione dell\'oro, le banche a riserva totale si sono inevitabilmente trasformate in banche a riserva frazionaria, approfittando dell\'arbitraggio generato dal divario di velocità tra l\'oro e i depositi bancari. Sfruttando il fatto che le persone raramente ritiravano il loro oro, hanno creato sistemi intrinsecamente instabili che funzionavano \"per la maggior parte del tempo\", ma che occasionalmente richiedevano salvataggi finanziari quando fallivano. Da quel punto in poi, le banche a riserva frazionaria sono state inevitabilmente centralizzate dai rispettivi governi e interconnesse a livello globale attraverso i sistemi di telecomunicazione. I metalli sottostanti sono stati quindi eliminati come garanzia per decreto governativo quando i governi non desideravano più essere vincolati da essi. Ogni volta, in ogni giurisdizione, gli utenti della valuta hanno accettato la transizione nell'arco di decenni. Anche quando le valute fiat falliscono in un paese, la popolazione tende a passare a una nuova valuta fiat emessa o a utilizzare la valuta fiat di un altro paese --- come il dollaro --- piuttosto che tornare all\'oro come mezzo di scambio.

Il registro della natura (l\'oro) possiede parametri robusti per quanto riguarda l\'offerta e la svalutazione, ma non si muove né viene verificato abbastanza rapidamente nell\'era delle telecomunicazioni. Il registro dell\'umanità (il dollaro) si sposta e viene verificato con sufficiente rapidità, ma non presenta parametri altrettanto robusti per l\'offerta e la svalutazione. L\'unico modo per colmare questo divario di velocità, nel lungo periodo, sarebbe lo sviluppo di un asset monetario portabile, ampiamente accettato e scarso, che possa anche essere regolato su lunghe distanze alla velocità della luce.
